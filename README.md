Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report.
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial services company that handles sensitive customer information. They needed their web application to be more secure so client data would not be exposed to hackers. My job was to find security weaknesses in the software and fix them to help protect their system.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I did well at reviewing the vulnerability report, identifying the problems, and applying the correct fixes without breaking the program. I made sure the system still worked properly after making security updates.

Coding securely is important because it protects private information and prevents cyberattacks. Strong security builds customer trust, protects the company’s reputation, and prevents financial loss. It also helps the company follow laws and regulations.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most challenging part was understanding the vulnerability scan results and deciding which issues were the most serious. However, it was helpful because it improved my ability to analyze security risks and prioritize fixes.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased security by enabling HTTPS, updating insecure dependencies, and making sure encryption and hashing were properly used. This added multiple layers of protection.

In the future, I would use tools like dependency-check scanners, static code analysis tools, and follow OWASP security guidelines to decide what fixes are needed.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

After making changes, I tested the application to make sure it still worked correctly. I re-ran vulnerability scans to confirm that the issues were fixed and that no new problems were created.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used secure coding practices like encryption, proper dependency management, and input validation. I also used vulnerability scanning tools and followed security best practices. These skills will be helpful in future software projects.

What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I could show employers my vulnerability report, the changes I made to improve security, and the updated secure code. This project shows that I understand how to find and fix security issues while keeping software working properly.
